# Practice Rust: Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Rust, created as part of a learning process.

The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of data structures, algorithms, and the Rust programming language. The implementations here are built from scratch and include test cases to verify their functionality.

## Implemented Data Structures

1. Vector
2. Linked List (with and without tail)
3. Queue (using linked lists and fixed-size arrays)
4. Hash Table (with linear probing)

Each data structure is contained in its own module and includes a set of tests to validate its functionality.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. Binary Search

The algorithms are implemented as separate modules and include test cases to ensure their correctness.

## Getting Started

To run the tests for all data structures and algorithms, navigate to the root directory and run `cargo test`.

## Contribution

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or new data structure / algorithm implementations, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Disclaimer

While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of these implementations, they may still contain bugs or mistakes. Use them at your own risk.
