# Rust Data Structures Learning Repository

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in Rust, created as part of a learning process. 

The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of data structures and the Rust programming language. The data structures implemented here are built from scratch and include test cases to verify their functionality.

## Implemented Data Structures

1. Vector
2. Linked List with and without tail
3. Queue using linked lists and fixed size arrays 
4. Hash Table with linear probing

Each data structure is contained in its own module and includes a set of tests to validate its functionality.

## Getting Started

To run the tests for all data structures, navigate to the root directory and run `cargo test`.

## Disclaimer

While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of these implementations, they may still contain bugs or mistakes. Use them at your own risk.
